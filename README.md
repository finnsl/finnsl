# Martin Finn-Sell

I'm interested in Machine Learning and Statistics for Data Science. In my previous life I was a mathematician working in geometric group theory and operator algebras - I specialised in using graph theoretic sampling methods to solve problems. 

Right now, I'm finishing the Asigmo data science bootcamp, and experimenting with a variety of convolutional networks using pytorch. My future goals are to understand the intersection of deep learning, topological data analysis and coarse geometric methodology.
